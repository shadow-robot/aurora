# Aurora project #

The main purpose of this subsystem is to unify one-liners approaches based on Ansible best practices. This one-liner is able to install Docker, download the specified image and create a new container for you. It will also create a desktop icon to start the container and launch the hand.

## Before running the docker-deploy playbook ##

Before setting up the docker container, ethercat_interface parameter for the hand needs to be discovered. In order to do so, after plugging the hand’s ethernet cable into your machine and powering it up, please run
```shell
sudo dmesg
```
command in the console. At the bottom, there will be information similar to the one below:
```shell
[490.757853] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): enp0s25: link becomes ready
```
In the above example, ‘enp0s25’ is the ethercat_interface that is needed. 

## How to run docker-deploy playbook ##

Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and run:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls bit.ly/run-aurora) docker-deploy option1=value1 option2=value2 option3=value3
```

Possible options for the docker-deploy are:
<pre>
* product                   Name of the product (hand_e or hand_h)
* tag                       Tag of the exact Docker hub image to pull (default: kinetic-devel)
* reinstall                 Flag to know if the docker container should be fully reinstalled (default: false)
* container_name            Name of the docker container
* ethercat_interface        Ethercat interface of the hand
* nvidia_docker             Enable nvidia docker (default: false)
* desktop_icon              Generates a desktop icon to launch the hand (default: true)
* config_branch             Specify the branch for the specific hand (Only for dexterous hand)
* shortcut_name             Specify the name for the desktop icon (default: Shadow_Hand_Launcher)
* optoforce                 Specify if optoforce sensors are going to be used with a branch name (default: false)
* launch_hand               Specify if hand driver should start when double clicking desktop icon (default: true)
* customer_key              Flag to prompt for customer key for uploading files to AWS (can be skipped or be set to true)
* cyberglove                Specify the branch of sr_cyberglove_config for cyberglove configuration (default: false)
* demo_icons                Generates desktop icons to run demos (default: false)
</pre>

Also, for debugging (not using the master branch), you can add the following immediately after docker-deploy:

* --debug-branch name_of_aurora_repo_branch (e.g. --debug-branch F#SRC-2603_add_ansible_bootstrap)

Also, for teleop demo, please specify production/staging/development using the --inventory tag:

* --inventory name_of_inventory (e.g. --inventory staging)

Run a playbook against one or more members of that group using the --limit tag:

* --limit rules (e.g. --limit 'all:!server' please use single quotes. More details could be found 
[here](https://ansible-tips-and-tricks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible/commands/#limit-to-one-or-more-hosts))

To begin with, the docker-deploy playbook checks the installation status of docker. If docker is not installed then a 
new clean installation is performed. If the required image is private, 
then a valid Docker Hub account with pull credentials from Shadow Robot's Docker Hub is required. Then, 
the specified docker image is pulled and a docker 
container is initialized. Finally, a desktop shortcut is generated. This shortcut starts the docker container and 
launches the hand.

Example:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls bit.ly/run-aurora) docker-deploy product=hand_e ethercat_interface=enp0s25
```
